**D1:    The Second Perishability Principle **
> Decentralize control for problems and opportunities that age poorly

**D2:    The Scale Principle **
> Centralize control for problems that are infrequent, large, or that have significant economics of scale

**D3:    The Principle of Layered Control **
> Adapt the control approach to emerging information about the problem

**D4:    The Opportunistic Principle **
> Adjust the plan for unplanned obstacles and opportunities

**D5:    The Principle of Virtual Centralization **
> Be able to quickly reorganize decentralized resources to create centralized power

**D6:    The Inefficiency Principle **
> The inefficiency of decentralization can cost less than the value of faster response time

**D7:    The Principle of Alignment **
> There is more value created with overall alignment than local excellence

**D8:    The Principle of Mission **
> Specify the end state, its purpose, and the minimal possible constraints

**D9:    The Principle of Boundaries **
> Stablish clear roles and boundaries

**D10:    The Main Effort Principle **
> Designate a main effort and subordinate other activities

**D11:    The Principle of Dynamic Alignment **
> The main effort may shift quickly when conditions change

**D12:    The Second Agility Principle **
> Develop the ability to quickly shift focus

**D13:    The Principle of Peer-Level Coordination **
> Tactical coordination should be local

**D14:    The Principle of Flexible Plans **
> Use simple modular plans

**D15:    The Principle of Tactical Reserves **
> Decentralize a portion of reserves

**D16:    The Principle of Early Contact **
> Make early and meaningful contact with the problem

**D17:    The Principle of Decentralized Information **
> For decentralized decisions, disseminate key information widely

**D18:    The Frequency Response Principle **
> We can't response faster than our frequency response

**D19:    The Quality of Service Principle **
> When response time is important, measure response time

**D20:    The Second Market Principle **
> Use internal and external markets to decentralize control

**D21:    The Principle of Regenerative Initiative **
> Cultivating initiative enables us to use initiative

**D22:    The Principle of Face-to-Face Communication **
> Exploit the speed and bandwidth of face-to-face communications

**D23:    The Trust Principle**
> Trust is built through experience
