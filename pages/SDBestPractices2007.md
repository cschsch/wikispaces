title: SDBestPractices2007
---
This page contains various stages of a project used as an example for code coverage. You'll need several things for this to work:
* [The Java Development Kit](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [Emma Eclipse Plugin](http://www.eclemma.org/installation.html)

Install each of these in order listed above.

Next, you'll need the workspace. Here is a complete Eclipse workspace:
[[file:SdBestPractices2007.zip]]


* Download the file.
* Extract the file somewhere, e.g.
  * PC: C:\workspaces
  * Mac: /Users/Schuchert/Workspaces
* This creates a directory called SdBestPractices2007 under the directory to which you extracted the zip file.
* Start eclipse
* Select the directory "SdBestPractices2007" under your target extraction directory 
* Verify your tests run
  * Right-click on your project
  * Select Run:JUnit Tests
  * Verify all 106 tests pass
