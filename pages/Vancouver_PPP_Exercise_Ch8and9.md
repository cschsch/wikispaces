## Exercises for Chapters 8 and 9
This exercise is meant to give you a feel for how to organize your classes into releasable components. The end result of this exercise is a listing of classes and interfaces that should all be grouped together to be released.

You'll work on two exercises:
* Part 1: After reviewing the Principles of Component Cohesion, we'll try to extract out a component from the below diagram for a new client of our system.
* Part 2: After reviewing the Principles of Component Coupling, we'll evaluate your results, compare them with the starting point and take another swag at componentization.

* [Part 1: Unit 8 Exercise](PPPChapter8Exercise)
* [Part 2: Unit 9 Exercise](PPPChapter9Exercise)
* [Part 3: Repackaging Exercise](PPPChapter9RepackagingExercise)
