# Elevator Pitch
* **//For//** developers wishing to get practice creating systems using [TDD](Test_Driven_Development)
* **//Who//** are interested in starting with user stories that follow the [INVEST](User_Stories_I.N.V.E.S.T) principle
* **//Our//** RPN Calculator problem is a complete problem 
* **//That//** gives users a rich enough to practice simple [TDD](Test_Driven_Development)
* **//Unlike//** other problems that take you through the process step by step
* **//Our Product//** only provides the starting point from which you are expected to begin practicing

## Alternative Approach
[As I've Actually Taught It](Rpn_Calculator.WithRefactoringAndPatterns)

# Getting Started

Here are some steps to get you started:
### Project Setup
# Create a workspace in eclipse
# Make sure to have separate source folders, one called src, one called test
# Add JUnit lib to your project's classpath

### TDD
# Pick the highest listed user uncompleted user story
** Create a test for the first uncompleted UAT
** Get the test to compile
** Get the test to run
** Refactor if necessary
** Check in your source code
# Repeat until all UAT's are done for the current user story
# Repeat until all user stories for the current release are finished
