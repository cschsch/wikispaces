# Getting Started

Here are some steps to get you started:
**Project Setup**
# Create a workspace in eclipse
# Make sure to have separate source folders, one called src, one called test
# Add JUnit lib to your project's classpath

**TDD**
# Pick the highest listed user uncompleted user story
** Create a test for the first uncompleted UAT
** Get the test to compile
** Get the test to run
** Refactor if necessary
** Check in your source code
# Repeat until all UAT's are done for the current user story
# Repeat until all user stories for the current release are finished
