# Elevator Pitch
* **//For//** developers wishing to get practice creating systems using [[Test Driven Development|TDD]]
* **//Who//** are interested in starting with user stories that follow the [[User Stories I.N.V.E.S.T|INVEST]] principle
* **//Our//** RPN Calculator problem is a complete problem 
* **//That//** gives users a rich enough to practice simple [[Test Driven Development|TDD]]
* **//Unlike//** other problems that take you through the process step by step
* **//Our Product//** only provides the starting point from which you are expected to begin practicing

# Getting Started

Here are some steps to get you started:
**Project Setup**
# Create a workspace in eclipse
# Make sure to have separate source folders, one called src, one called test
# Add JUnit lib to your project's classpath

**TDD**
# Pick the highest listed user uncompleted user story
** Create a test for the first uncompleted UAT
** Get the test to compile
** Get the test to run
** Refactor if necessary
** Check in your source code
# Repeat until all UAT's are done for the current user story
# Repeat until all user stories for the current release are finished
