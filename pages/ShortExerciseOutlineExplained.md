## Explained
While not part of the learning cycle per-se, I'm adding this step for three reasons:

* Some people will want to see a summary and explanation so I'm attempting to more directly address some learning styles/preferences. 
* This is a place to put additional notes that might not have been discussed in the group. 
* If you are working on your own, it would be handy to have this information.
