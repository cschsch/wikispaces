As of Number 2013, all tutorials and videos I record will be done using a virtual machine. If you are on this page, you could be setting up that VM.

* Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). As of this writing, I'm using 4.3.2
* Download and install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). As of this writing, I'm using 1.3.5
* Clone the following git repo TBD
* Start a shell, type "vagrant up"
