Luckily I already have macports installed, so to add both I simply used it:
[[code]]
> sudo port install scala 2.7.1
> sudo port install erlang
[[code]]

Of course I'm at a hotel, so it takes some time to do both of these.

I'm going to start working at the command line before I try to get some eclipse plugins to work with either. Keep the number of new things low.
