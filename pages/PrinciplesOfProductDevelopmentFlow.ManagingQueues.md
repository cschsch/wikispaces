### Q1:    The Principle of Invisible Inventory 
Product development inventory is physically and financially invisible

### Q2:    The Principle of Queueing Waste 
Queues are the root cause of the majority of economic waste in product development

### Q3:    The Principle of Queueing Capacity Utilization 
Capacity utilization increases queues exponentially

### Q4:    The Principle of High-Queue States 
Most of the damage done by a queue is caused by high-queue states

### Q5:    The Principle of Queueing Variability 
Variability increases queues linearly

### Q6:    The Principle of Variability Amplification 
Operating at high levels of capacity utilization increases variability

### Q7:    The Principle of Queueing Structure 
Serve pooled demand with reliable high-capacity servers

### Q8:    The Principle of Linked Queues 
Adjacent queues see arrival or service variability depending on loading

### Q9:    The Principle of Queue Size Optimization 
Optimum queue size is an economic trade-off

### Q10:    The Principle of Queueing Discipline 
Queue cost is affected by the sequence in which we handle the jobs in the queue

### Q11:    The Cumulative Flow Principle 
Use CFDs to monitor queues

### Q12:    Little’s Formula 
Wait Time = Queue Size / Processing Rate

### Q13:    The First Queue Size Control Principle 
Don't control capacity utilization, control queue size

### Q14:    The Second Queue Size Control Principle 
Don't control cycle time, control queue size

### Q15:    The Diffusion Principle 
Over time, queues will randomly spin seriously out of control and will remain in the state for long periods

### Q16:    The Intervention Principle
We cannot rely on randomness to correct a random queue
