# Problem

Right now, the solution provided in [Exercise 4]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ Exercise 4) enables tracking changes on an object when any of its fields change. What if I wanted to ignore certain fields?

Spend a few moments and try to figure out how you might go about accomplishing that. Please do so before continuing.
