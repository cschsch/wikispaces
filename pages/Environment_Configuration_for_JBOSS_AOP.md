title: Environment_Configuration_for_JBOSS_AOP
---
You'll need the Sun JDK, Eclipse and JBoss AOP to run these examples.

## JDK
These examples require JDK 1.5.0 or later. They were written using JDK 1.5.0_06. I installed this using the defaults, so it is in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06.

Download the Sun JDK from [here](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp) and install it.

## Eclipse
These examples require Eclipse 3.x. They were written using Eclipse 3.1. You can install Eclipse anywhere you wish, for these examples I installed Eclipse in c:\aop, which created c:\aop\eclipse.

Download Eclipse from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and install it.

## JBoss AOP
These examples require JBoss AOP 1.5.0. They were originally written using 1.3.4 with custom patches until 1.5.0GA became available. For these examples, I unzipped the download into c:\aop, which created c:\aop\jboss-aop_1.5.0.GA.

Download JBoss AOP from [here](http://www.jboss.com/products/list/downloads#aop).

## Eclipse Configuration for JBoss AOP
