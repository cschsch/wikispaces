If you do not have access to git, you can download a zip file:
* Download this zip file: 
[[file:embedded_cpp_tdd.zip]]
* Extract it to some location, e.g.// **C:\Projects**//

This will create a directory called: C:\Projects\embedded_cpp_tdd

You'll need to include the following directories in your include path:
* C:\Projects\embedded_cpp_tdd\
* C:\Projects\embedded_cpp_tdd\boost\tr1
