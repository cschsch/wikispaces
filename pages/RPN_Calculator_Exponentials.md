As a user I can use exponential notation to enter large numbers so I do not have to enter large numbers and possibly make a mistake.

### UAT
* [] 2 ```<e>``` 3 ```<enter>``` -> [2000]
* [] ```<e>``` 6 ```<enter>``` -> [1000000]
* [] 1.2 ```<e>``` 4 ```<enter>``` -> [12000]
* [] -4 ```<e>``` 5 ```<enter>``` -> [-400000]
* [] 20 ```<e>``` -1 ```<enter>``` -> [2]
