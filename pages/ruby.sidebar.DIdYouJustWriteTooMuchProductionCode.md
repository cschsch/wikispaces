<span class="sidebar_title"> Did you just write too much production code?</span>
You've written just enough to make everything pass, so no. Doing the simplest thing that can possible work does not mean you cannot write support methods. It is sometimes (often times) OK to follow existing form. However, the danger is you are copying what is already a bad form so you need to always use your most important refactoring tool - your brain.

When you do follow form, expect that those support methods will initially be simple, even empty (e.g., handle_paren).
