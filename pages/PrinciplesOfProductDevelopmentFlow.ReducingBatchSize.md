**B1:    The Batch Size Queueing Principle **
> Reducing batch size reduces cycle time

**B2:    The Batch Size Variability Principle **
> Reducing batch size reduces variability in flow

**B3:    The Batch Size Feedback Principle **
> Reducing batch sizes accelerates feedback

**B4:    The Batch Size Risk Principle **
> Reducing batch size reduces risk

**B5:    The Batch Size Overhead Principle **
> Reducing batch size reduces overhead

**B6:    The Batch Size Efficiency Principle **
> Large batches reduce efficiency

**B7:    The Psychology Principle of Batch Size **
> Large batches inherently lower motivation and urgency

**B8:    The Batch Size Slippage Principle **
> Large batches cause exponential cost and schedule growth

**B9:    The Batch Size Death Spiral Principle **
> Large batches lead to even larger batches

**B10:    The Least Common Denominator Principle of Batch Size **
> The entire batch is limited by its worst element

**B11:    The Principle of Batch Size Economics **
> Economic batch size is a U-curve optimization

**B12:    The Principle of Low Transaction Cost **
> Reducing transaction cost per batch lowers overall costs

**B13:    The Principle of Batch Size Diseconomies **
> Batch size reduction saves much more than you think

**B14:    The Batch Size Packing Principle **
> Small batches allow finer tuning of capacity utilization

**B15:    The Fluidity Principle **
> Loose coupling between product subsystems enables small batches

**B16:    The Principle of Transport Batches **
> The most imporant batch is the transport batch

**B17:    The Proximity Principle **
> Proximity enables small batch sizes

**B18:    The Run Length Principle **
> Short run lengths reduce queues

**B19:    The Infrastructure Principle **
> Good infrastructure enables small batches

**B20:    The Principle of Batch Content**
> Sequence first that which adds value most cheaply

**B21:    The Batch Size First Principle **
> Reudce batch size before you attack bottlenecks

**B22:    The Principle of Dynamic Batch Size**
> Adjust batch size dynamically to response to changing economics
