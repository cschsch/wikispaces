# Expected Versus Actual Output

## Expected Output
Did you guess that there is no output? Given what you’ve been shown, there should be no output. Of course, given the first example, you might have predicted otherwise.
## Actual Output
Here’s the actual output:
```
Setting addressLine1 from null to 5080 Spectrum Drive
Setting addressLine2 from null to Suite 700 West
Setting city from null to Dallas
Setting state from null to TX
Setting zip from null to 75001
Setting zip from 75001 to 75001
```
## Assignment: Form a Theory
