## Half-Day, Whole Thing
This is a very rapid, hit all the big areas kick-off. After this, we go through all of the subjects again but in more depth.

* Exercise: **Group** Preliminary stories
* Exercise: **Group** I.N.V.E.S.T
* Exercise: **Group** Sequencing
* Exercise: **Group** Release Planning

## Project Kick-off
### Setting the Context
* [[Context Free Questions]]
### Elevator Pitch
* Examples
* Hand Out Projects to **groups**

* All **groups** report back
* Pass 2
* All **groups** report back
* **Class** exercise, what makes a good elevator pitch?
----
## User Stories
### Examples
* Three kinds
** Users ask for it: e.g. I want to withdraw money from ATM
** Users assume: I can check my balance
** Users won't ask but must be there: security, logging in
* Exercise: **Groups brainstorm** user stories (15 minutes)
** **Class** all groups report back
** **Class** exercise: What should stories have?
### I.N.V.E.S.T

** Exercise: **Group** Brainstorm with cards
** Organize
** Consolidate
** Refine
* Exercise: **Class** exercise, how do you consolidate?(cohn06)
** Frequency
** Level of expertise
** Proficiency with computers
** Proficiency with software
** General goal
----
## User Stories Revisited
### Recommendations
* For each role, develop stories
* For each story, use one role
* Exercise: **Group** find additional stories
* Exercise: **Groups** report back on differences using roles
* Exercise: **Class** where do you explore? (cohn06, ch04)
** User Interviews
** Questionnaires
** Observation
** Story-Writing workshops
----
## Conditions of Satisfaction
### General Discussion
* Examples
* Exercise: **Group** add/update tests for 3 stories
* Exercise: **Groups** report back
* Exercise: **Class** what makes a good test (cohn06, ch6)
** Express details from conversations
** Document assumptions
** Basic criteria to know if story is implemented
** Clarify details
** Write before coding
** Customer specifies
** Testing is part of process
----
## Executable Tests: FitNesse
### Example
* FitNesse-based acceptance tests demonstration
* Walk-through
** Tables
** Fixtures
** General organization
### Project Wiki
* Preliminary Project Organization
* Expressing Stories With Tables
** Different kinds of stories
** Common setup and configuraiotn
** Who does what?
----
## Story Guidelines
### Exercise: **Class** what makes a good story? (chon06, ch07)
* Start with user role goal epics* Slice the cake
* Write closed stories
* Put constraints on "constraint cards" (first version of quality attributes)
* Size relative to time horizon
* Defer UI as long as possible
* Common sense, some things are not stories
* Include roles
* Write for one user
* Write in active voice
* Customer writes them
* Do not number your cards
* It's a reminder/placeholder, not the requirements
## Preliminary Story Sequenceing
### Initial Story Stack
* MoSCoW Story Stack
** Must have for release 1, 2, 3, etc.
** Should have for release 1
** Could have
** Won't have this time
----
## Estimation and Story Points
### Exercise: **Group** story points must haves for release 1
* Exercise: **Class** problems with estimation
* Estimation Process 2: Wide-band Delphi
** Note: Conversation starts, ends, cards updated
** Discuss Story
** Independent estimation
** Discuss high/low
** Repeat until group is close (more than 3x is an issue)
** After you have "a few" triangulate
** Continue with stack after triangulation
----
## Release Planning
### Iteration, Part 1
* 1 - 4 weeks
* Stories developed, tested, usable
### Sequencing, part two
* Why don't we use the work priority?
* Exercise: **Group** sequencing stories
* Exercise: **Class** discussion on sequencing
** Customer always wins
** Applies to a lot of customers
** Applies to a few important customers
** Cohesion to other stories
** Address risk
** Addresses constraints/infrastructural needs
### Sequencing part three
* Sum of pairs of comparisons
* Exercise: **Group** review & review sequen
### Iteration, Part 2
* Story points per iteration
* Plan iterations
* Velocity
** Guessing
** Run initial iteration
** Historical
* Exercise: **Group** develop release plan
* Exercise: **Class** discussion recommendations and guidelines
----
## Iteration Planning
### Planing Poker
* Discuss stories, highest priority first
* Break into tasks
* Estimate tasks
* Take assignments
* Validate sensibility
----
## Post Iteration
### Assessing Progress
* Measure actual velocity
* **Group** exercise, measure velocity
** Assign developer role to member of group
** S/he picks how much was completed
** Any new stories to add?
** Any experience suggesting changing other stories?
** Exercise: **Group** burn-down chart 1
### Iteration Planning Simulation
* [[IterationPlanningSimulationInstructions]]
* Repeat the first process a few times
* Add a few, re-estimate a few
* Practice measuring velocity
* Practice developing burn-down charts
----
## Additional Project Work
* Equipment Repair Facility
----
