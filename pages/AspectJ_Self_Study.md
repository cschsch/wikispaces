AOP is an abbreviation for Aspect Oriented Programming. For now, that’s all you’re going to get for a definition. Why is that? Because this set of exercises assist you in defining AOP for yourself. You’d do that anyway; we all do, so these notes work off that fact. 

If you prefer to work from concrete examples, consider having a look here:
> [[Some Example Aspects]]

These exercises use a particular tool, AspectJ, but the concepts apply equally well to JBoss AOP (see: [[JBoss AOP Self Study]]).

Even though I’m expecting you to define AOP for yourself, I am assuming you have a basic understanding of Java Programming. If not you might be somewhat frustrated.

Before you begin, you'll need to setup and configure your environment. To do that, go here: [[Environment Configuration for AspectJ]]

Note, these examples are written to mimic how I present them in a workshop environment. That is deliberate. I'm hoping you'll work through these examples on your own similar to how I'd have people work through them in a workshop environment.

Examples meant to get you up to speed on self-defining what AOP means:
* [[AspectJ Example 1]] or you can get the [PrintLayout]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ Example 1 PrintLayout)
* [[AspectJ Example 2]]
* [[AspectJ Example 3]]
* [[AspectJ Example 4]]

The following examples and exercises may be performed in any order. The listing below seems to work alright:
* [CFlow]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ CFlow)
* [Annotation Start]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ Annotation Start)
* [Generics Start]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ Generics Start)
* [[AspectJ Research Docs]]
* [[AspectJ Object Versioning]]
* [[AspectJ Observer Pattern]]

Once you've worked through all of the above examples, you'll next want to work on this project:
* [[AspectJ Assignments for Provided Project]]
