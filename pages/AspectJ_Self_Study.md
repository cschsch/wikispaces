AOP is an abbreviation for Aspect Oriented Programming. For now, that’s all you’re going to get for a definition. Why is that? Because this set of exercises assist you in defining AOP for yourself. You’d do that anyway; we all do, so these notes work off that fact. 

If you prefer to work from concrete examples, consider having a look here:
> [Some_Example_Aspects]({{site.pagesurl}}/Some_Example_Aspects)

These exercises use a particular tool, AspectJ, but the concepts apply equally well to JBoss AOP (see: [JBoss_AOP_Self_Study]({{site.pagesurl}}/JBoss_AOP_Self_Study)).

Even though I’m expecting you to define AOP for yourself, I am assuming you have a basic understanding of Java Programming. If not you might be somewhat frustrated.

Before you begin, you'll need to setup and configure your environment. To do that, go here: [Environment_Configuration_for_AspectJ]({{site.pagesurl}}/Environment_Configuration_for_AspectJ)

Note, these examples are written to mimic how I present them in a workshop environment. That is deliberate. I'm hoping you'll work through these examples on your own similar to how I'd have people work through them in a workshop environment.

Examples meant to get you up to speed on self-defining what AOP means:
* [AspectJ_Example_1]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_1) or you can get the [PrintLayout]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_1_PrintLayout)
* [AspectJ_Example_2]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_2)
* [AspectJ_Example_3]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_3)
* [AspectJ_Example_4]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_4)

The following examples and exercises may be performed in any order. The listing below seems to work alright:
* [CFlow]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_CFlow)
* [Annotation Start]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Annotation_Start)
* [Generics Start]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Generics_Start)
* [AspectJ_Research_Docs]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Research_Docs)
* [AspectJ_Object_Versioning]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Object_Versioning)
* [AspectJ_Observer_Pattern]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Observer_Pattern)

Once you've worked through all of the above examples, you'll next want to work on this project:
* [AspectJ_Assignments_for_Provided_Project]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Assignments_for_Provided_Project)
