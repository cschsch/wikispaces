## Estimation
### Estimation
* Helps make decisions
* Priority/sequencing of work
* Splitting/merging user stories
* How much can we do?
* Helps to build trust

### Warning:
* Not only law of diminishing returns
* More might actually be less

### Quick exercise
* What do you think is the relationship between time spent estimating and accuracy?

----
## Group Exercise – Estimation
### In your groups…
* How have you estimated work in the past?
* What is the relationship between work load and deadlines?
* Scope, Resources, Deadline, Quality…
** Which of these do you explicitly decide upon
** Which do you leave hanging?
** Who chooses each of these? Customers, users, developers, ???

----
## Class Exercise – Estimation Observations
Report back from your group meeting

----
## Individual Exercise – Estimation
Note, this example comes from Cohn’s “User Stories Applied”

### Individually…
* From 1 to 10, estimate each based on average height at their shoulders:
** Labrador Retriever
** Vizsla
** Terrier
** Great Dane
** Standard Poodle
** French Bulldog
** Dachshund
** German Short-haired Pointer

----
## Group Exercise – Estimation
### In our groups of 4…
* From 1 to 10, estimate each based on average height at their shoulders:
** Labrador Retriever
** Vizsla
** Terrier
** Great Dane
** Standard Poodle
** French Bulldog
** Dachshund
** German Short-haired Pointer

* Be prepared to discuss the difference in the two experiences

----
## Class Exercise – Compare Individual/Group
Discuss your differences between the individual exercise and the group exercise

----
## Story Points
### Story points
* Are relative
* Are arbitrary units of measure
* Each team defines how they see fit
* Combine complexity, size, risk, etc.

### Who?
* The whole team
* Users/customers provide input, answer questions
* Developers make the call

### NOTE!
* Estimates are the exclusive purview of developers
* No manager/product owner bullying.

----
## Approaches (Must Haves Only)
### Planning Poker
* Someone reads user story
* Product owner answers any questions
* Everybody selects an estimate from a collection of cards
* Everybody shows their estimate
* If “wide” variation, group discussion (with time box)
* Repeat until “near” convergence
* To organize this, 
* Have decks of prepared cards (playing cards, 3x5 cards)
* One deck per person estimating (developers)
* Each deck has same set of numbers, 
** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
** 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 17, 27

----
## Group Exercise – Estimates
**In your groups…**
* Remember to make your meeting work
* Use planning poker on a few cards
* Notes
* Really, it is only developers who estimate
* Product owners, users, managers do not estimate
* Be prepared to discuss your answers
** Ah-ha’s
** Oh’s
