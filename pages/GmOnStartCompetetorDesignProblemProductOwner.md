* They real way to make money is to have some kind of a per-transaction revenue stream. For example,
  * 411 service, with GPS-based location recommendations
  * Hard to get restaurant reservations
  * Concert & Movie tickets
  * Finding stores with particular items in stock (e.g. a Wii)
  * Etc.
* Of course, there should be some integration available with a drivers mobile phone
* There should be several categories of service:
  * Wired: Diagnose vehicle problems, Remote entry, Locate vehicle, Roadside assistance, Virtual Advisor (google maps integration - some per-transaction fee basis)
  * Traveler: Basic Service + trip planning (pre-paid, as opposed to per-transaction the basic service plan), Find a ride home with Ride Assist
  * Corporate: for rental agencies with equipped services - e.g. Hertz, a plan that offers a per-use fee plan. The driver can enable or disable it after renting a car.
