## General Exercise Outline

These exercises are written in a particular order in an attempt to help you learn on your own. They generally follow these steps:

# Present a program and ask you to predict output
# Show expected versus actual output
# Ask you to think about **how** to make the actual output happen
# Present a few possibilities of **how**
# Ask you to describe in general **what** is happening
# Present examples of possible **what**
# Describe how the output is actually happening
# Present you with some assignments to allow you to practice (solutions will eventually be provided)
# Ask you to think about how you might apply this to your situation
# Provide some typical applications
# Ask you to think about issues this technique might raise
# Provide some typical issues

This is an attempt to provide a self-paced experiential learning experience sans an instructor.
