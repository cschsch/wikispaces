# # Eclipse Plugins and Configuration ==
I'm using a few plugins in Eclipse for much of this work. This is the list of plugins and configuration notes. Note the first one really could be its own category, but I'm only using Subversion via Eclipse, so I've included it here.

* [[Subversion on XP]]
* [[PMD In Eclipse]]
* [[Checkstyle in Eclipse]]

# # AOP Configuration ==
* [[Environment Configuration for AspectJ]]
* [[Environment Configuration for JBOSS AOP]]

# # Other Useful Configuration Notes ==
* [[Commons Logging and Log4j Config]]
* [[Wikispaces Style Sheet]]
