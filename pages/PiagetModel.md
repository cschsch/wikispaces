## Piaget's Model of Learning Process
"The learner was neither an 'empty vessel' to be filled with knowledge nor a 'blank slate' on which knowledge could be inscribed, but a system that learned through its own interaction with its environment." -- Learning by Design: Constructing Experiential Learning Programs, Weinberg & Weinberg. 

### The Steps
Piaget's model of learning comprises four steps: 
* Provocation 
* Disequilibration 
* Self-regulation 
* New learning 

### Provocation
We present the students with something that in some way challenges them. This could be as simple as asking for a list of words and putting the words on two different charts. It is like a foreign element in the SatirChangeModel. 

### Disequilibration
The learner literally is "off balance." This is the chaos stage in the SatirChangeModel. The student is looking for a way to take in or reject the provocation experience. 

### Self-regulation
Self-regulation comes comes in two forms: 
* Assimilation
* Accommodation 

Moving from disequilibration into self-regulation is like the transforming idea in the SatirChangeModel. 

**Assimilation**
The learner rejects the data, experience, or considers "just like something else." 

**Accommodation**
The learner rejects his/her existing model in lieu of the new information.
 
In reality, these are opposite ends of a spectrum. A given learner will often use one or both to varying degrees while self-regulating. 

### New Knowledge
As a result of the entire experience, the learner has new knowledge. This is something the learner constructed him/herself. We cannot control what the learner has learned but we can guide it through the design of experiential learning situations.
