This is a summary of material in the excellent [Principles of Product Development Flow by Donald G. Reinertsen](http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B007TKU0O0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1404767505&sr=8-2&keywords=principles+of+production+development+in+kindle). I'm working with the material in multiple ways to internalize all of its contents.
