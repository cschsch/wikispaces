title: lombok
---
In March of 2014 I joined a project that was using [Project Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/), which takes advantage of Java Annotation Processors to remove unneeded boilerplate code. What I found a bit confusing was getting started. I have no plans for this subject, other than a getting started writeup.
