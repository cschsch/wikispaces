|Long parameter list|Too many arguments to keep straight (> 3)|
|Duplicated code|Same or similar code appears in more than one place|
|Divergent change|The class/method changes for dissimilar reasons|
|Shotgun Surgery|Single change affects multiple classes/methods|
|Feature Envy|One class uses another classÂ¿ members|
