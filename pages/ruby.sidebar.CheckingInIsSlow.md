<span class="sidebar_title"> Checking in is slow</span>
What if checking in takes too long - that is, you hesitate to check in frequently because you don't want to wait for it? Can you find a way to reorganize your repository? As a developer and consultant, I see a lot of examples of poorly configured repositories or just poorly written tools and it frustrates me when my tools slow me down.
