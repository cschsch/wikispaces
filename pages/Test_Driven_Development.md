## Introduction

This page contains examples to use when practicing or teaching [Test_Driven_Development](Test_Driven_Development) (TDD).
* [The Three Rules of TDD](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
* [Red_Green_Refactor](Red_Green_Refactor)

## Examples
Here are a few stand-alone examples: [TDD_Example_Catalog](TDD_Example_Catalog)

## Projects
* [RPN_Calculator](RPN_Calculator)
* [Monopoly](Monopoly)

## Use in a C++ Class
Here is the beginnings of an example TDD session using the [Monopoly](Monopoly) as the basis and [C++](Cxx_TDD_Monopoly) as the language.

* [Notes on CppUTest](tdd.cpp.NotesOnCppUTest)
* [Notes on CppULite](NotesOnCppULite)
* [TwoDayTddJavaEclipseWorkspace](TwoDayTddJavaEclipseWorkspace)
* [C++ Project Outline](tdd.cpp.ProjectOutline)
* [Moving towards a story-based expression of tests](tdd.cpp.MovingTowardsStoryBasedExpressionOfTests)

## Use in a Java Class

Use a TDD approach for the [RPN_Calculator](RPN_Calculator). 

Next, use the [Monopoly](Monopoly) problem.

* For each "release"
  * User story workshop
  * Sequence user stories
  * For each user story in the release:
    * Develop UAT
    * Create communication diagram(s) in support of the UAT's for a given story
    * Use TDD to implement it
  * Check in the story
  * Finish the release and move on

## In a C# Class
* [CSharpTddNotes](CSharpTddNotes)
* [Moq](Moq)

## For Objective-C
