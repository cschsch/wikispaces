# Introduction

This page contains examples to use when practicing or teaching [[Test Driven Development]] (TDD).
* [The Three Rules of TDD](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
* [[Red Green Refactor]]

# Examples
Here are a few stand-alone examples: [[TDD Example Catalog]]

# Projects
* [[RPN Calculator]] ([print](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/RpnCalculatorPrintable?f=print))
* [[Monopoly(r)]]  ([print](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/MonopolyPrintable?f=print))

# Use in a C++ Class
Here is the beginnings of an example TDD session using the [[Monopoly(r)]] as the basis and [[Cxx TDD Monopoly|C++]] as the language.

# Use in a Java Class

Use a TDD approach for the [[RPN Calculator]]. 

Next, use the [[Monopoly(r)]] problem. 
* For each "release"
** User story workshop 
** Sequence user stories 
** For each user story in the release: 
*** Develop UAT 
*** Create communication diagram(s) in support of the UAT's for a given story 
*** Use TDD to implement it 
** Check in the story
** Finish the release and move on
