**W1:    The Principle of WIP Constraints** 
Constrain WIP to control cycle time and flow

**W2:    The Principle of Rate-Matching**
WIP constraints force rate-matching

**W3:    The Principle of Global Constraints**
Use global constraints for predictable and permanent bottlenecks

**W4:    The Principle of Local Constraints**
If possible, constrain local WIP pools

**W5:    The Batch Size Decoupling Principle**
Use WIP ranges to decouple the batch sizes of adjacent processes

**W6:    The Principle of Demand Blocking**
Block all demand when WIP reaches its upper limit

**W7:    The Principle of WIP Purging**
When WIP is high, purge low-value projects

**W8:    The Principle of Flexible Requirements**
Control WIP by shedding requirements

**W9:    The Principle of Resource Pulling**
Quickly apply extra resources to an emerging queue

**W10:    The Principle of Part-Time Resources**
Use part-time resources for high variability tasks

**W11:    The Big Gun Principle **
Pull high-powered expets to emerging bottlenecks

**W12:    The Principle of T-Shaped Resources **
Develop people who are deep in one area and broad in many

**W13:    The Principle of Skill Overlap **
Cross-train resources at adjacent processes

**W14:    The Mix Change Principle **
Use upstream mix changes to regulate queue size

**W15:    The Aging Principle **
Watch the outliers

**W16:    The Escalation Principle **
Create a preplanned escalation process for outliers

**W17:    The Principle of Progressive Throttling **
Increase throttling as you approach the queue limit

**W18:    The Principle of Differential Service **
Differentiate quality of service by workstream

**W19:    The Principle of Adaptive WIP Constraints **
Adjust WIP constraints as capacity changes

**W20:    The Expansion Control Principle **
Prevent uncontrolled expansion of work

**W21:    The Principle of the Critical Queue **
Constrain WIP in the section of the system where the queue is most expensive

**W22:    The Cumulative Reduction Principle **
Small WIP reductions accumulate

**W23:    The Principle of Visual WIP**
Make WIP continuously visible
