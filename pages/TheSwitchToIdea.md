When I started working on this wiki, I wanted to only use free tools since the material here is released for free. At the time I was a long-time Eclipse user. A few years ago I switched to IntelliJ at work but continued to use Eclipse for projects on this site where using a Java IDE made sense. For some time now, there's been a free version of Idea, I personally own the commercial version of Idea, but I verified this works with the free community edition. If you want to use Eclipse, there are instructions on how to integrate Lombok with IntelliJ at the project lombok web site. Quick hint, run the lombok jar file with java and it will attempt to find your Eclipse installation and update it.
