#Experiential Learning Notes =
In 2001 I took a workshop form Jerry Weinberg on Experiential Learning. It was called the X workshop. I did a few things with the material right away. Then it went dormant for me for a few years. Recently (April 2006) I started down that path again. Now I'm trying to get a better grip on what it means to use and develop Experiential Learning. I've started working on moving a somewhat traditional technology course into one that is predominately Experiential. You can see the beginnings of that [[JBoss AOP Self Study|here]].

This page is the place where I've replicated notes I created from that workshop years ago.
