## Background and Intent
This presentation serves as a 1 - 2 hour practice session on basic user story experience.

For this series of exercises we will:
* Break up in to small groups (4 - 5 people)
* Repeatedly:
** Work on a problem within the group
** Present findings back the the class as a whole
** Summarize and fill out any missing details

Near the end, we'll have one final exercise where your groups will be given an assignment and compete with all of the other groups.

We'll conclude with a "where do we go next" wrap-up.

## Exercise 2
### Group Exercise
Review provided project and develop a few ideas for things your system should do:

### IPod® Killer
Your company has recently acquired another company, which has designed yet another IPod® killer. The hardware will be available for preliminary shipment in 2 months but there is not really any kind of support for selling music. Your company has agreements with several record labels to be able to sell DCMA’ed versions of songs but not much of a web presence in this arena.

The marketing department of your company has decided to take these two assets, record label agreements and this new, as yet unnamed IPod® killer, and produce a customer experience similar to ITunes®.
You have approximately 2 ½ - 3 months to produce some kind of web presence that will make using this new device fun for its target audience.

### Discussions with Product Owner
During initial discussions with the product owner, a few things may become clear (if asked):
* The new player comes in a few forms but it can hold approximately 200, 400, 600 or 8000 songs.
* The cost is roughly $150, $175, $200, $215
* The players are targeted to the youth market, which is big on customization
* There are a couple of different models, targeted to teenage boys and girls
* They want to be able to sell the device, accessories and customizations online
* Customizations include engraving, decals and even multi-tone colors
* They want people to spend time on their site, like a social-networking site
** The want to support chatting
** Friends
** Share photos
** Email
** Etc., the usual social networking stuff, targeted towards teens
** They are concerned with problems that MySpace has had, so they want their site to be safe
* The device supports music and photos (including album art)
* They are working on a contract with CDDB to get track information
* They want their client to be able to rip music as well. They have licenses a product to do that for both the PC and the MAC.

### Report Back
* What one idea really stood out?
* What worked in terms of generating ideas?
* What challenges did you have?

### Wrap-UP
* How does this "start" compare to your project starts?

Who are your users? Who are the purchasers? In your groups, develop a list of candidate user roles for the provided project and give a brief description for each.

### Report Back
* User roll-call

### Wrap-Up
* Any stand-outs?
* Do you notice any relationship between who you think will be using your system and what the system might be doing?

## Example User Stories
### Online Itinerary Maintenance

## Exercise 4
### Group Exercise
Pick one of your user roles. For this one user role, identify candidate user stories.

### Report Back
* Provide one of your stories (we'll do this round-robin)
* How was working with user roles different from just picking out ideas from a few exercises back?
* If you're working with actual people, how many "different roles" should you interview at the same time?

### Conclusions
* What stood out for you?
* Did you get any good ideas from the other teams?

----
## Exercise 5
### Group Exercise
Pick a second user role and repeat the previous exercise.

### Report Back
* Round-robin again.
* How did this time feel different from the previous times?

### Wrap-Up

* How do you use roles (or a similar concept) now?
* Can you take this back to your work and start using it?

## Exercise 6
### Group Exercise
The facilitators will provide materials and basic instructions for the final project. You'll be expected to elicit requirements.

## Summary/Where Next
### Discussion
Here are some questions to consider:
* What do you take away from this?
* Anything you can use tomorrow? In a week? In a month?
* Anything you see never using?
* Where do you see roadblocks to using user stories? 
* How do you currently hand off functionality from product owners to developers?
* How much do you need to write down versus communicate?
