==GM OnStart® Competitor==
GM offers a product called OnStart®, which provides several in-car features. Ford, with sagging sales, recently said they are going to have an on-board computer built into several models of cars for similar functionality. Other manufacturers are considering similar systems but this is outside of their core competence.

We have a little funding, enough for around 6. We'd like to offer a manufacturer=independent solution we can license to Ford and other manufacturers. We want to offer a complete service with some kind of revenue sharing agreement with Ford and other companies to give them a compelling reason to use us instead of building a proprietary, in-house solution.

We believe the only way we have a chance is to get something in front a manufacturer with a working system.
