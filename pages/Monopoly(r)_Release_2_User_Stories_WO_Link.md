### Optional
If you finish ahead of the class, work on the following:
* If a player's balance ever goes below 0, they lose. If you're playing with 2 players, the other player is announced as the winner. Setup your players to demonstrate this happening.
* Allow for more than 2 players. Have one player run out of money and the other 2 continue playing through the remainder of the 20 rounds.
* Allow for more than 2 players. Have all but one player run out of money over time (not all during the same turn). Announce the one remaining player as a winner.
