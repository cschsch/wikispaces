title: Environment_Configuration_for_AspectJ

You'll need the Sun JDK, Eclipse and AspectJ to run these examples.

## JDK
These examples require JDK 1.5.0 or later. They were written using JDK 1.5.0_06. I installed this using the defaults, so it is in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06.

Download the Sun JDK from [here](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp) and install it.

## Eclipse
These examples require Eclipse 3.x. They were written originally written using Eclipse 3.1.2. I noticed no problems switching to Eclipse 3.2. You can install Eclipse anywhere you wish, for these examples I installed Eclipse in c:\aop, which created c:\aop\eclipse.

Download Eclipse from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and install it.

## AspectJ
These examples require AspectJ 1.5. They were originally written using 1.5.1. For these examples, I unzipped the download into c:\aop\aspectj.

Download AspectJ [here](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php).

## Eclipse Configuration for AspectJ
The following additional configuration sets will set your Eclipse configuration up the way I've set it up for all of these examples. You can click on individual links or just follow the [Next-->]({{ site.pagesurl}}/Eclipse VM Configuration for AspectJ) link below:
