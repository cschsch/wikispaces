## ITunes® Competitor
Your company has recently formed a partnership with a Chinese company that is working on yet another IPod® killer. Samples of the hardware will be available in one month, with actual production hardware becoming available in limited supplies in 2 - 3 months.

Due to another acquisition, your company has agreements with several recording companies with permission to sell protected contented music.

Currently, your company has no presence on the web in either of these two fields. Nor is it really to have any kind of traction in either of these fields.

You have a chance to form a new startup with these two assets. To do so, you have to show some market penetration on the web and some ability to put these two assets together into a compelling product. You should consider targeting the teen audience.
