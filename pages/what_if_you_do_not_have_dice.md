## No Dice?
Find three coins of different denominations. For this example I'll assume you are using a penny, nickel and a dime.

Pick one to be the "low" value (penny in my case)
Pick one to be the "middle" value (nickel)
Pick one to be the "high" value (dime)

Flip all three (together if you like) and record heads or tails for each coin.

Use the following table to figure out what you "rolled":
||**High**||**Medium**||**Low**||**Value**||
||**Dime**||**Nickel**||**Penny**||**Rolled**||
