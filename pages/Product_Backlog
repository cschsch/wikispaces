This is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(management)|SCRUM]] term.

A product backlog enumerates work to be done for a project and the current sequence in which the team will develop solutions.

If we are using [[User Story|User Stories]] to describe our work, then the backlog is a listing of user stories listed in the intended implementation sequence.
