### FF1:    The Principle of Maximum Economic Influence 
> Focus control on project and process parameters with the highest economic influence

### FF2:    The Principle of Efficient Control 
> Control parameters that are both influential and efficient

### FF3:    The Principle of Leading Indicators 
> Select control variables that predict future system behavior

### FF4:    The Principle of Balanced Set Points 
> Set tripwires at points of equal economic impact

### FF5:    The Moving Target Principle 
> Know when to pursue a dynamic goal

### FF6:    The Exploitation Principle 
> Exploit unplanned economic opportunities

### FF7:    The Queue Reduction Principle of Feedback 
> Fast feedback enables smaller queues

### FF8:    The Fast-Learning Principle 
> Use fast feedback to make learning faster and more efficient

### FF9:    The Principle of Useless Measurement 
> What gets measures may not get done

### FF10:    The First Agility Principle 
> We don't need long planning horizons when we have a short turning radius

### FF11:    The Batch Size Principle of Feedback 
> Small batches yield fast feedback

### FF12:    The Signal to Noise Principle 
> To detect a smaller signal, reduce the noise

### FF13:    The Second Decision Rule Principle 
> Control the economic logic behind a decision, no the entire decision

### FF14:    The Locality Principle of Feedback 
> Whenever possible, make feedback local

### FF15:    The Relief Valve Principle 
> Have a clear, predetermined relief valve

### FF16:    The Principle of Multiple Control Loops 
> Embed fast control loops inside slow control loops

### FF17:    The Principle of Controlled Excursions 
> Keep deviations within the control range

### FF18:    The Feedforward Principle 
> Provide advance notice of heavy arrival rates to minimize queues

### FF19:    The Principle of Colocation 
> Colocation improves almost all aspects of communication

### FF20:    The Empowerment Principle of Feedback 
> Fast feedback ives a sense of control

### FF21:    The Hurry-Up-and-Wait Principle 
> Large queues make it hard to create urgency

### FF22:    The Amplification Principle 
> The human element tends to amplify large excursions

### FF23:    The Principle of Overlapping Measurement 
> To align behaviors, reward people for the work of others

### FF24:    The Attention Principle
> Time counts more than money
