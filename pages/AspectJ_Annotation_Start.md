title: AspectJ_Annotation_Start
---
I'm still trying out different formats. I have the long format as demonstrated by [Example 1]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_1), [Example 2]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_2), [Example 3]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_3) and [Example 4]({{ site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Example_4). I've got two different approaches for this example:

## [Version 1]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Annotation_Experience)
This version follows [[ShortExerciseOutline]] as described in the [[Experiential Learning]] section.

The outline can be summarized by: Experience --> Observation --> Generalization --> Explained --> Apply

It begins by presenting you with all the information you need to describe what is going on and how it is accomplished. Your goal is to look over several code snippets and figure it out. Next, it asks you to answer a few questions to fill out your observations. It continues with asking you to generalize what you've observed. It then explains in detail how this example works. It concludes with a series of exercises to apply what you've learned.

## [Version 2]({{site.pagesurl}}/AspectJ_Annotation_Problem)
The outline can be summarized by: Problem --> Alternatives --> Short explanation --> Explained --> Apply

This version beings by posing a problem. In this case the problem posed is "How can you skip change tracking on individual fields." Next, it asks you to consider several possible alternative solutions. Next, it shows a short version of how to solve the problem one way. It then presents a more detailed, line-by-line solution like the one in version 1. It concludes with a series of exercises.
