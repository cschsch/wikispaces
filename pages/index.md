I'm attempting to create materials people will find useful for learning some tool or technology. Along the way I'm personally practicing with experiential learning. So if you think the layout or approach to these various exercises is a bit strange, maybe that's why.

For more background on where I'm coming from, have a look at [ExperientialLearningNotes]({{site.pagesurl}}/ExperientialLearningNotes).
