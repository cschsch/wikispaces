# Expected Versus Actual Output=

## Expected Output==
Is the what you guessed the output would be?
[[code]]
Exception in thread "main" java.io.NotSerializableException: ex3.Die
	at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(ObjectOutputStream.java:1075)
	at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(ObjectOutputStream.java:291)
	at ex3.Main.serializeObject(Main.java:36)
	at ex3.Main.main(Main.java:16)
[[code]]
Notice that the Die class does not implement Serializable or Externalizable, so the Main.main() method should not have been able to Serialize the object.

## Actual Output==
Hereâ€™s the actual output:
[[code]]
Serialization successful
[[code]]
By now you've figured out that the expected and actual output are generally not the same.

## Assignment: Form a Theory==
Spend a few moments and try to figure out how to make this output happen. Write down those ideas. Please do so before continuing to the next section.
