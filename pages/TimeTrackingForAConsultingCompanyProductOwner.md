## Time Tracking Product Owner

As the product owner, you are privy to more information. Feel free to revel this information as you are questioned.

* Consultants typically work on a single project. However, they can work on up to 4 projects. This is handled by different pages in the existing spreadsheet. In the future, we'd like to allow for more than 4 projects.
* Consultants only record actual billing time. We'd like to allow for more fidelity, e.g. travel, corporate contributions:
** Corporate Contributions: Presenting at Conferences & User Groups, Publishing in magazines and books, Internal development such as course development, Certification
** Travel Time: Billable & Non billable
** Under Client time: Development, Mentoring, Infrastructure
* Configurable email reminders would be handy
** A formatted email, which could be replied to, to allow time tracking would be nice
* All projects have a single engagement manger. The same engagement manager can manage multiple projects. Time sheets, once turned in, are reviewed by the engagement manager. Engagement managers need to be informed when the y have time sheets to improve. When all parts of a time sheet are approved (e.g. working on multiple projects), the time sheet is successfully completed.
** All of this is true for expense reports.
* Generating summary reports of hours worked on a project, billing clients, expense reports, etc. are were the real time-savings could happen. This is very important as we're running out of capacity to keep up on a monthly basis.
