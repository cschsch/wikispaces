==Overview
This week's dojo is a "competition" of sorts. Individuals, pairs or groups of people working with their own equipment, language and tools will work on a part of the overall problem. After a timebox, we will regroup and discuss:
* Techniques
* Approach
* Tests (if any)
* Interface/how does it work?

==Problem
Do two time slots conflict with each other?
