V1:    The Principle of Beneficial Variability 
> Variability can create economic value

V2:    The Principle of Asymmetric Payoffs 
> payoff asymmetries enable variability to create economic value

V3:    The Principle of Optimum Variability 
> Variability should neither be minimized or maximized

V4:    The Principle of Optimum Failure Rate 
> Fifty percent failure rate is usually optimum for generating information

V5:    The Principle of Variability Pooling 
> Overall variation decreases when uncorrelated random tasks are combined

V6:    The Principle of Short-Term Forecasting 
> Forecasting becomes exponentially easier at short time-horizons

V7:    The Principle of Small Experiments 
> Many small experiments produce less variation than one big one

V8:    The Repetition Principle 
> Repetition reduces variation

V9:    The Reuse Principle 
> Reuse reduces variability

V10:    The Principle of Negative Covariance
> We can reduce variance by applying a counterbalancing effect

V11:    The Buffer Principle 
> Buffers trade money for variability reduction

V12:    The Principle of Variability Consequence 
> Reducing consequences is usually the best way to reduce the cost of variability

V13:    The Nonlinearity Principle 
> Operate in the linear range of system performance

V14:    The Principle of Variability Substitution 
> Substitute cheap variability for expensive variability

V15:    The Principle of Iteration Speed 
> It is usually better to improve iteration speed than defect rate

V16:    The Principle of Variability Displacement
> Move variability to the process stage where its cost is lowest
