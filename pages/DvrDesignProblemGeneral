==Digital Video Recorder
Trying to beat the competition to develop a better set-top box, the company you work for has designed a new DVR with built-in MPEG-4 encoding, hardware based high-definition HD up and down sampling (it can handle 720 I and P and 1080 I and P), all with a terabyte of storage and 2GB of memory. It also includes two HDMI ports, Ethernet connectivity, optical outputs, etc.

We need to create an amazing user experience that includes watching live TV; recording up to 4 additional channels while watching a 5th already-recorded video and creating something similar to a season pass that will record all occurrences of a given show on a given channel.

There is an upcoming trade show in 19 weeks and we need something to demonstrate if we want to have a chance at making any kind of impact in the next year. Since we generally spend most of our marking dollars at this trade show, the deadline is important.
