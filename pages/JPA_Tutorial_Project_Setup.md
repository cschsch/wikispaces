### Create Java Project===
Next we need to create a Java project. We'll keep the source separate from the bin directory:
# Pull down the **File** menu and select **New:Project**
# Select **Java Project** and click on **Next**
# Enter a project name: **<project>**, again read [[JPA Tutorial 1 - Getting Started#SideBarJpaClassPath|this]] to know why I did not use a space in the project name.
# Make sure "Create new project in workspace" is selected.
# Make sure the JRE selected is 1.5.x or higher. If such a JRE does not show in the list, you can add it through Window->Preferences->JAVA->Installed JRE's.
# Select **Create separate source and output folders**
# Click **Finish**

### Create folders and packages===
# Expand your **<project>** folder
# Select the **src** directory
# Right-click, select **new:Folder**
# Use the name **META-INF**
# Make sure **<project>** is still selected, right-click and select **New:Source Folder**
# Enter **test** and click **OK**

### Add Required Libraries===
We now need to add two libraries. Note that these steps assume you've already worked through the first tutorial and are working in the same workspace. If you, you'll need to create user libraries. Review [[JPA Tutorial 1 - Eclipse Project Setup#AddRequiredLibraries|Creating User Libraries]].
# Edit the project properties. Select your **<project>** and either press **alt-enter** or right-click and select properties.
# Select **Java Build Path**
# Click on the **Libraries** tab
# Click on **Add Library**
# Select **User Libraries** and click **Next**
# Select **JPA_JSE** by click on the check box
# Click **OK**
# Click on **Add Library** again
# Click on **JUnit**
# Click **Next**
# In the pull-down list, select **JUnit 4**
# Click **Finish**
# Click **OK**

If you'd like some background information on JUnit, please go [[JUnit 4.x|here]].
