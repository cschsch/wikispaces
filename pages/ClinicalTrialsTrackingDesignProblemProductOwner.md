## Clinical Trials Tracking Product Owner

As the product owner, you have a little more information. Feel free to share this if you are asked about it:
* We need a solution that we can host as well as one that can be hosted locally.
* HIPPA requirements are going to be an issue, especially if we host the solution.
* Here's a typical process:
** Patient schedules appointment
** Patient arrives and fills out forms (or fills them out online before arriving)
** Patient is prepared by clinical technician
** Clinical technician applies tests and records results
** Patient finishes up and checks out
** Data and notes are recorded
** The information is made available to the doctor requesting the tests
** The on-side doctor can annotate with additional notes
* Weâ€™re concerned about ease of use by different groups of people whose computer skills will tend to vary quite a bit.
