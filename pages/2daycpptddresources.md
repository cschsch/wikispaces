This is a list of resources for a 2-day C++ class covering a rage of topics including:
* Test Drive Development
* Refactoring (Martin - Refactoring)
** rename method
** rename class
** extract method
** extract class
** replace switch/conditional logic with polymorphism
** encapsulate typecode
* Legacy Refactoring (Feathers - Working Effectively with Legacy Code)
** characterization tests
** extract class
** extract method
* Design Patterns
** [[CppRpnCalculatorStrategyPatternExample|strategy pattern]]
** [[CppRpnCalculatorTemplateMethodPatternExample|template method pattern]]
** [[CppRpnCalculatorAbstractFactoryPatternExample|abstract factory pattern]]

## Projects
* RPN Calculator: Here's some source code for the [[RpnCalculatorCppExampleImplementation|Rpn Calculator in C++]] (RPN --> Reverse Polish Notation --> post-fix, think HP calculators)
* Refactoring (with tests in place): [[file:CalculateRates_clean_code.zip]]
* Refactoring (conditional logic to polymorphism): [[file:CalculateRates_conditional_to_polymorphism.zip]]
** [[ReplaceSwitchWithPolymorphismDetailedRefactoringInstructions]]
* Characterization Tests: [[file:CalculateRates_characterization.zip]]
* After polymorphism applied: [[file:CalculateRates_polymorphism_applied.zip]]

## Working in Visual Studio with this Files
# Download zip file
# Download CppUTest
# Get it built in your version of visual studio
# Create a new project (win 32 console), e.g. RpnCalculator, CleanCode, ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism, Characterization, PolymorphismSolved
# Select solution and add existing project
# Find your CppUTest solution folder and add the project file
# Have your new project (RpnCalculator, CleanCode, etc.) depend on the CppUTest project
# Update your new project's include directory to include the include directory of CppUTest
# Find the zip file, open it and extract all of the files into the source directory of your project
# Select your project and add existing, add all of the header and source files
