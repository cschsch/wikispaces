## Short Exercise Outline Observation
Second, I'll ask the person to "take a step back" and make some observations about their recent experience:
* What is happening?
* How is this different from your previous experience?
* What were your expectations?
* What in the code do you think is driving the effect?
* How do you think this is accomplished?
