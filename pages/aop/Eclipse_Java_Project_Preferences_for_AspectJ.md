In these examples, I have Eclipse configured to use separate src and bin directories. This is an optional step.

In Eclipse:
* Pull down the **Windows** menu
* Select **Preferences**
* Select **Java**
* Select **Build Path**
* Under "Source and output folder" select **Folders**
* In **Source folder name:** enter **src** (this is the default value)
* In **Output folder name:** enter **bin** (this is the default value)
* Click **OK**

{% include nav prev="Eclipse_Java_Language_Preferences_for_AspectJ" next="Save_Workspace_Configurations_for_AspectJ" %}
