3# AspectJ Annotation: Thinking

Taking your observations into consideration, take a moment to do the following things:
* Describe in a general way what is happening. "What" not "How".
* Relate this "what" back to some example other than the one provided.
* Describe other ways in which you might use this kind of example.
* Contrast this with some of the other experiences you've already had in the subject area.
* How might you mix this idea with others you've already seen?
