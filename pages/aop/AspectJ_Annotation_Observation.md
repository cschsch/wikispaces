# AspectJ Annotation: Observation

Now review what you've just experience. Take a few moments and write down answers to the following questions:
* What is happening?
* How is this different from your previous experience?
* What were your expectations?
* What in the code do you think is driving the effect?
* How do you think this is accomplished?
