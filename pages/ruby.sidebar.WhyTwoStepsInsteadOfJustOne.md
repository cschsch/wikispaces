<span class="sidebar_title"> Why two steps instead of just one?</span>
Why not just create a method and in the same step get your Example passing? In this trivial example you could and it would not be too risky. However, in general you should make sure your Examples fail for the right reason before getting them to pass. Why? It serves as a check that the Example you've written is doing what you think it is doing. 

With proper IDE support, the intermediate failing step to the working step is seconds. Even with the environment I'm using, two terminal windows, the work is 10 - 15 seconds. So while this is "extra" work, it has a purpose.

Eventually you will see these tutorials skipping steps. But for now, the tutorial is keeping the rigor high.
