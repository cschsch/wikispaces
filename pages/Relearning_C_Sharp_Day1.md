So I'll start by creating a new C# project and adding a reference to nunit.framework.
# new project, C#, class library
# right-click references, add reference, nunit.framework
# Remember that a unit test class must be public!
# Turn off intelli-sense since it will "complete" when you're using a class for the first time.
# When you create a new class, it is put in the same file as the one you're working in (the test). This is unfortunate.
