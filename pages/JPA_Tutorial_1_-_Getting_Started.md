# Introduction
This first tutorial gives you an opportunity to work with:
* setting up a persistent unit, 
* creating in-memory entities and 
* persisting those entities to a database. 

You'll write the code such that the environment creates the database schema based on meta-information (annotations) in your entity classes.

Good luck!
