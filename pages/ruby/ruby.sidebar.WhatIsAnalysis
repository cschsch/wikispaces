: synopsis: breaking something into its constituent parts. When you are thinking about adding a new feature, learning how to break it down, while requiring practice for most of us, is a valuable skill to practice. Start with the assumption that it can be broken down, because it's nearly always possible. Typically you'll pick a partial solution that, by itself, does not complete anything. In fact, that's what this entire tutorial has been demonstrating. Think about it in terms of questions. If you cannot figure out the whole thing, are there any questions you can answer that move you in the direction? Can you then state that question as a test, or experiment? Once you've written the experiment, unlike testing a hypothesis to check your model of reality, you// **define**// reality by writing production code to match your hypothesis. If you do not like the reality that you have created, change the definition of reality (your tests), and then alter your universe to match.
