**F1:    The Principle of Congestion Collapse **
> When loadinb becomes too high, we will see a sudden and catastrophic drop in output

**F2:    The Peak Throughput Principle **
> Control occupancy to sustain high throughput in systems prone to congestion

**F3:    The Principle of Visible Congestion **
> Use forecasts of expected flow time to make congestion visible

**F4:    The Principle of Congestion Pricing **
> Use pricing to reduce demand during congested periods

**F5:    The Principle of Periodic Resynchronization **
> Use a regular cadence to limit the accumulation of variance

**F6:    The Cadence Capacity Margin Principle **
> Provide sufficient capacity margin to enable cadence

**F7:    The Cadence Reliability Principle **
> Use cadence to make waiting times predictable

**F8:    The Cadence Batch Size Enabling Principle **
> use a regular cadence to enable small batch sizes

**F9:    The Principle of Cadenced Meetings **
> Schedule frequent meetings using a predictable cadence

**F10:    The Synchronization Capacity Margin Principle **
> To enable synchronization, provide sufficient capacity margin

**F11:    The Principle of Multiproject Synchronization **
> Exploit scale economics by synchronizing work from multiple projects

**F12:    The Principle of Cross-Functional Synchronization **
> Use synchronized events to facilitate cross functional trade-offs

**F13:    The Synchronization Queueing Principle **
> To reduce queues, synchronize the batch size and timing of adjacent processes

**F14:    The Harmonic Principle **
> Make nested cadences harmonic multiples

**F15:    The SJF Scheduling Principle **
> When delay costs are homogeneous, do the shortest job first

**F16:    The HDCF Scheduling Principle **
> When job durations are homogeneous, so the high cost-of-delay job first

**F17:    The WSJF Scheduling Principle **
> When job durations and delay costs are not homogeneous, use WSJF (weighted shortest job first)

**F18:    The Local Priority Principle **
> Priorities are inherently local

**F19:    The Round-Robin Principle **
> When task duration is unknown, time-share capacity

**F20:    The Preemption Principle **
> Only preempt when switching costs are low

**F21:    The Principle of Work Matching **
> Use sequence to match jobs to appropriate resources

**F22:    The Principle of Tailored Routing **
> Select and tailor the sequence of subprocesses to the task at hand

**F23:    The Principle of Flexible Routing **
> Route work based on the current most economic route

**F24:    The Principle of Alternate Routes **
> Develop and maintain alternate routes around points of congestion

**F25:    The Principle of Flexible Resources **
> Use flexible resources to absorb variation

**F26:    The Principle of Late Binding **
> The later we bind demand to resources, the smoother the flow

**F27:    The Principle of Local Transparency **
> Make tasks and resources reciprocally visible at adjacent processes

**F28:    The Principle of Preplanned Flexibility**
> For fast responses, preplan and invest in flexibility

**F29:    The Principle of Resource Centralization **
> Correctly managed, centralized resources can reduce queues

**F30:    The Principle of Flow Conditioning**
> Reduce variability before a bottleneck
