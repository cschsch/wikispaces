I'm just getting started ... want to see something, ask:
>> schuchert at yahoo dot com
>> schuchert at objectmentor dot com
>> shoe at objectmentor dot com
>> Tweet me: http://twitter.com/schuchert

All of these involve using Boost inside VS 2008. To get started, install it:
* Go here: http://www.boostpro.com/products/free
* Register an account (it's free)
* Select the version you want
* Select the parts you want
* Install. 
* These instructions are pretty clear. They are out of date because they do not mention VS 2008, but the installer does. Otherwise, seems to work very well.

Up first? I'm considering the following examples:
* Threading
* Regex
* Sockets
