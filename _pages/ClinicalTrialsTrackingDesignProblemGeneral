==Clinical Trials Tracking==
Small clinics are popping up all over performing specialized clinical trials and observations. One common example is labs specializing in sleep studies and sleep disorders.

We want to build a turnkey system to sell to these smaller labs. At the very least, it should track patient information, room information and schedules. Tracking anybody who works on a patient is also important and it needs to be very simple.

Given recent changes in federal laws, there's a window of opportunity in the next year to develop a system we could sell to several clinics. However, before that we have an upcoming trade show where we want to begin to demonstrate functionality. We need something we can demonstrate in 4 months, but we probably need something sooner so we can train staff attending the trade show.
