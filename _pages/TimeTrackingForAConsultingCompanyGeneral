==Time Tracking for a Consulting Company==
A consulting company has a large percentage of traveling consultants. Currently, time and expenses are tracked by sending an email with an excel spreadsheet. This does not scale well and the company is experiencing heavy growth. 

The fiscal year ends in 4 months and billing cycles are twice a month. A minimal time tracking system needs to be in place before then to allow consultants to start using the new system. Given the existing excel spreadsheets, we'd like to be able to continue using them though some kind of import functionality.

If we can get a web-based interface in place as well, all the better. However, we'd like to keep the spreadsheets as an option simply because it allows off-line time and expense tracking.
