Complete is a tough word to define for a project. Often, when a developer says something is "complete" or "done" s/he is saying "I've coded it." In fact, this is nowhere near complete.

Here are a minimal set of characteristics to define something as complete:
* Code Written
* Unit Tests Written
** Unit tests running reliably
** Unit tests running independently with no side effects
** Unit test running quickly
* Code integrated with rest of source base
** All unit tests passing after integrating
* Code checked in to repository
* User acceptance tests validated as running (manually OK, automated better)

Before even getting started, it should be clear to the team what "done" or "complete" mean.
